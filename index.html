<p>
  Hello. I'm James. This is my website that I'm creating as a fun little project to learn some css and html. Moreover it
  would be nice to have a place to publish projects, ideas, and simply just things I find interesting. As well as some 
  shameless plugging and promotion of course for all those looking to buy my time/skills on the job market. 
</p>
<p>
  While I get to grips with the very basics of web development, this site will likely spend a while lacking a lot of the core funtionality
  that I'd like to eventually add, such as an interactive, richly formatted CV, a set of blog-style posts about little 
  side projects, progress trackers for coding challenges (advent of code, project euler) and things like language learning
  progress. 
</p>
<p>
  I guess we'll just have to wait and see how it turns out.

    This site is still under construction. Thanks for your patience.
