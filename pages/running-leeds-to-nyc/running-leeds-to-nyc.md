# Running Progress: Leeds -> New York City 🏃‍♂🗺
A visualisation of the total distance I have run, as of the start of 2023 (when I started recording on [my Strava page](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53847048)).

I have run **838.4 / 5404 km**, 15.5% through my trans-atlantic migration.

This map has been directly embedded using [geojson](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).
I have calculated the geodesic coordinates are calculated as a function of the fraction along the curve, using methods outlined [here](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html).

For now, I need to update this tracker manually, but in the future, I intend to automate this.
